## Abstract

Meritocracy is a fundamental idea in a meritocratic society is that inequality 
reflecting differences in performance is fair, but not The paper investigates
the talent paradox in a large-scale study of the US population. We establish
that Americans differentiate significantly between inequalities due to luck and
inequalities due talent, even when controlling for beliefs about the extent to
which talent is under individual control. In an experiment, we study possible
explanations for the talent puzzle, where we find evidence that people reward
talent (but not luck) because a person must act on it to make it valuable. Our
findings provide novel evidence on why Americans tend to accept talented
people being richer than others.
